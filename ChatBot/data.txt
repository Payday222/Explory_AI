Materials (fragments in polish and english)

March on Rome (October 1922)
The March on Rome was an organized mass demonstration and a coup d'état in October 1922 which resulted in Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party ascending to power in the Kingdom of Italy. In late October 1922, Fascist Party leaders planned an insurrection, to take place on 28 October. However, as king was scared of the civil war and decided to appoint Mussolini the PM, it eventually did not take place.
Corfu Incident (August 1923)
A group of Italians were working for the LON and marking the borders between Greece and Albania. The soldiers were attacked and one of them died. Benito Musolini demanded compensation and demanded the murderers be handed over to ITaly. Greeks didn't do that as they didn't know who the murderers were. As a result, Italians broke into Corfu which violated LON's covenant. The LON suggested that they will pay them the compensations and once the murders are found, they will return the money. Musollini was working behind the scenes and convinced the members of the covenant to support Italy instead of Greece. The LON asked Greece to pay Italy and then Italy removed its troops from Corfu.
Italy takes Fiume (1924)
→ Fiume belongs to Croatia and is called Rieka now.
--> Mussolini gained control over the disputed port of Fiume.
--> He believed he could intimidate Yugoslavs and undermine French influence there.
--> He tried to destabilize the country by funding ethnic groups who wanted independence.
Mussolini becomes an all-powerful dictator (1925)
CONDITIONS THAT ENABLED MUSSOLINI TO ESTABLISH AN ALL-POWERFUL DICTATORSHIP
--> Weak government which was constantly changing as well as its exclusive character and little involvement of the average members of the society (only the educated could decide about the country matters) contributed to rising common unrest.
- no integrity for Italians whose role was limited to paying taxes and army enrolment
--> Mutilated victory was making the society grieve greatly. The war not only brought many casualties, but also worsened the economic situation of Italy.
--> The country lacked key natural resources as well as was in debt which resulted in implementing high taxes on the poor. This led to more frequent revolts.
- slow economic growth compared to other countries
- differences in development of the North and South
- slow foreign trade
--> Opposition of the Church and objecting the new government after the unification definitely did not encourage Italians to support the authority. It influenced the general feelings about the government greatly, taking into account that over 90% of Italians at that time were Catholics.
--> Weakness of the king Victor Emmanuel who feared the civil war and decided to appoint Mussolini the PM despite his numerous faults which enabled Mussolini to slowly take over power.
--> Mussolini gained huge support from the beginning as he was seen as a solution to the rising unrest created by the fear of communism which he promised to fight against.
Locarno Treaties 1925
countries: Britain, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy
Established that the borders asserted by the Treaty of Versailles were unbreakable and the countries would never attack each other. The pact also emphasized the involved countries' commitment to aiding the League of Nations with military support in any potential conflicts.
--> seven resulting agreements aimed to secure the post-war settlement and normalise relations with Germany
--> they confirmed Germany's western borders with France and Belgium, but left its eastern borders for negotiations
Albania becomes Italian protectorate (1926)
--> thanks to an Italian-backed leader, Ahmed Zog, who took power in Albania, on Yugoslavia's border
--> Mussolini invested in his regime and helped train the Albanian army.
--> resulted in an official treaty of friendship between the two states
The crushing of revolt in Libya 1922-1928
--> pacification campaign that became a full-scale war
--> it was put down with a massive use of force and executions
Italo-Ethiopian Treaty (August 1928)
Treaty of Friendship
It a treaty signed between the Kingdom of Italy and the Ethiopian Empire on 2 August 1928.
Italy agreed to upholding lasting friendly relations with Ethiopia.
--> peaceful resolution through mediation
--> main objective: to resolve outstanding differences in East Africa
London Naval Conference (1930)
This conference was held to discuss naval disarmament and to review the treaties of the Washington Conference. France, Italy, Japan, England, and the US all participated in the conference. At the conclusion of the conference agreement had been made on regulation of submarine warfare and a moratorium of 5 years was placed on the construction of capital ships.
--> Italy left because of the ratios:
5:5:3:1.5:1.75
Four Power Pact (July 1933)
countries involved: Britain, France, Italy, and Germany
aim: safeguard the European balance of power with the hope of balancing peace and security in Europe
Mussolini's motive: closer relations with France
--> smaller nations should have less say in "Great Power" relations
--> signed by the four countries, however, France never ratified it
--> reaffirmed each country's adherence to the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Locarno Treaties and the Kellogg-Briand Pact
Why did Mussolini stop Hitler's attempts at Anschluss in 1934?
--> he wanted Austria to be independent
--> Mussolini didn't want Hitler to get too powerful
The Stresa Conference (April 1935)
involved: French Prime Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin (with Pierre Laval), British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini on 14 April 1935.
aim: reaffirm the Locarno Treaties and to declare that the independence of Austria "would continue to inspire their common policy".
The signatories also agreed to resist any future attempt by Germany to change the Treaty of Versailles.
Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935)
Britain accepted German naval rearmament without consulting it with other signatory counties in the Stresa Front.
Invasion of Abyssynia (October 1935)
→ Italians wanted to be equal to Britain and France.
more colonies, more powerful empires
→ economic: mines, more materials, land for Italy's increasing population
- Spacio vitale
→ Ethiopia was a poor country where slavery was common, therefore, Mussolini claimed to liberize Ethiopians.
→ France agreed: a consent was given
→ Britain
ordinary people did not care
Britain said they would take action, however, they wouldn't go to war.
→ a deal about the future of a foreign country was made
→ Ethiopia was lightly equipped, however, Mussolini did not manage to take it too quickly.
Mussolini used poisonous gas which was banned: Was he really bringing civilization?
Mussolini claimed it was not poisonous gas but leprosy.
Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935)
--> an initially secret proposal by British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Laval for ending the Second Italo-Ethiopian War
Italy had wanted to seize the independent nation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) as part of its Italian Empire and also avenge the 1896 Battle of Adwa, a humiliating defeat. The Pact offered to partition Abyssinia and thus partially achieve Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's goal of making the independent nation of Abyssinia into an Italian colony.
The proposal ignited a firestorm of hostile reaction in Britain and France and never went into effect. Hoare and Laval were both sacked.
- half of the Abyssinia was to be given to Italy
Mussolini tells the German ambassador he no longer has objection to Austria becoming a German satellite (January 1936)
After Abyssinian Crisis, when England and France stopped their friendly relations with Italy, Mussolini got closer to Germany. He said to the German ambassador that he no longer had objections to Austria becoming a German satellite, but he stressed that it must remain independent.
--> Mussolini would no longer uphold Locarno obligations
--> Mussolini told the Austrian government to deal directly with Germany: Italy would no longer protect Austria.

CONSEQUENCES
→ imposing limited sanctions (everything apart from rubber and oil) on Mussolini
- nobody wanted taking military actions to withdraw Italy from Ethiopia
- sanctions united the Italian nation against the LON
→ Italy gained Abyssinia
→ Italy was an empire: Rome was again the capital
→ peak of fascism and peak of the cult of the leader
→ Mussolini lost some friends: Britain, France
Italy felt betrayed
Mussolini turned to Germany
→ Italy left the LON 1937
→ SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE LON: collapse

INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE
--> The LON imposed sanctions, however, they were very limited and did not account for oil and rubber. Britain did not want too be too harsh as they wanted to maintain the Stresa Front against Germany they feared.
Italy intervenes in the Spanish Civil War (July 1936)
REASONS
--> emphasising military greatness
--> Italy hoped to gain naval bases in the Balearic Islands
--> aspirations to re-establish the Mediterranean Roman Empire
--> Mussolini wanted to stop communists from attaining a strategically important position at the mouth of the Mediterranean
--> 70,000 troops sent to Spain

CONSEQUENCES

--> one third of Italy's stocks were consumed by the war
--> increased tension between Italy, France and Britain
--> Spain did not become an Italian satellite state
--> Italy drew closer to Germany
Rome-Berlin Axis (October 1936)

countries: Germany, Britain, France, and Italy
--> the powers agreed to the German annexation of the Sudetenland (more than 3 million ethnic Germans)
--> seen as a way to prevent a major war on the continent
What was the role of Mussolini?
--> reputation: "peacemaker" at Munich
--> the conference highlighted weakness of Britain and France: Mussolini decided to take advantage of it
- the Italian parliament demanded the annexation of Corsica, Nice and Tunis from France
- Musso believed he could win a war against France and threaten Britain
Anti-Semitic laws implemented in Italy (1938)
As Mussolini drew closer to Germany, he was encouraged by Hitler to implement Anti-Semitic Laws. It worsened Musso's relations with the Catholic Church in Italy who opposed the laws.
Italy invades Albania (April 1939)
REASONS
→ catch up with Hitler's conquests
→ control of the Balkans: control of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic
--> asserting Italian strength
STRATEGIC REASONS
→ Albania was not strong: it used to be a satellite state of Italy (1926)
it was overtaken in one day
→ to threaten The UK (dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean)
→ economic reasons: agricultural potential

INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE
--> Britain and France condemned the Italian invasion of Albania
--> Chamberlain: provided Greek borders with British military support
Pact of Steel (May 1939)
--> the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy
--> a military and political alliance between Italy and Germany
--> initially between Japan, Italy, and Germany

--> Italy and Germany aimed the pact at Britain and France
--> signed by Ciano of Italy and Ribbentrop
The pact consisted of two parts:
I: an open declaration of continuing trust and co-operation between Germany and Italy
II: secret protocol encouraged a union of policies concerning the military and the economy
Why did Italy remain a non-belligerent in 1939?
When Germany invaded Poland, Mussolini said that Italy wouldn't be ready for a war until 1943. It was because Italy had been waging the war for several years in Africa and Europe which resulted in an inability to simply afford a new war.
Why did Italy join the war in June 1940?
--> not joining the war was contrary to the Fascist doctrine
--> Mussolini did not want Italy to become a lesser rank power
--> it was seen as an opportunity to radicalise the regime as well as remove the influence of conservatives and the Church
--> Mussolini was worried that Europe would be dominated by Germany.
--> a change for gaining territorial gains and control over the Mediterranean
--> economic: Mussolini was depended on the German coal imported through the sea which in March all German coal ports were blocked by Britain.
Attack on Egypt and Greece (June 1940)
--> both were failures due to the British response
--> it meant that Hitler's forces were drawn into both the Balkans and North Africa
--> German forces took Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941 and forced the evacuation of the British forces
--> Egypt was conquered in 1942
Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928)
The Kellogg-Briand pact was a pact that was written and sponsored by the US and France in an attempt to eliminate war. The terms of the pact declared that all signatory countries were to resolve issues in a peaceful diplomatic manner rather than resorting to war.

CHAPTER 2.1: THE IMPACT OF FASCISM ON ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY: THE ORIGINS, 1870.1933
Italy had only become a uniÉŔed state in 1861.
Before this it had consisted of a number
of independent states. It was through the
combined diplomatic and military actions
of the prime minister of Piedmont Sardinia,
Cavour, and Italian patriot Giuseppe
Garibaldi, that Italy could be uniÉŔed in
1861, with Rome and the Papal States ÉŔnally
joining the new Italian Kingdom in 1870.
Despite uniÉŔcation, Italian society after
1870 remained divided across geographical,
religious and social lines. These divisions
weakened Italian governments and, along
with the discontent and unrest caused by
ItalyˇŻs involvement in the First World War,
helped facilitate the rise to power of Mussolini
and his Fascist Party in 1922.
Once in power, Mussolini pursued an Italian
foreign policy that was inÉżuenced by a
number of factors. These included:
ˇÜ ItalyˇŻs geographical position and its limited
economic resources
ˇÜ the Versailles Settlement
ˇÜ nationalist views on the destiny of Italy to
become a great power and to have an empire
ˇÜ earlier foreign policy humiliations
ˇÜ the changing international context
ˇÜ Fascist ideology.
(Fascist ideology will be explored in detail later . see page 89.)

MussoliniˇŻs rise to power
What were the long-term weaknesses of Liberal Italy?
The period between 1870 and 1923 is an era known as Liberal Italy and
the inherent weaknesses that undermined Italy during this period would
ultimately facilitate the development of a Fascist dictatorship. Nevertheless, it
was not inevitable that the style of government to replace liberal democracy
would be Fascist rather than socialist or an authoritarian monarchy.
Lack of national identity
Despite the recent uniÉŔcation of the Italian state, Italy lacked a coherent
sense of an Italian identity. Piedmont had been the dominant state, and its
laws and political systems were imposed on the other states. Regionalism
remained a strong force, with many Italians feeling loyalty to their home
towns and cities, particularly in the south. The new capital in Rome had
limited support in this area. There were economic as well as political
divisions between the north and the south, with the majority of peasants in
the south living in abject poverty whilst the industrialized north prospered.
The Catholic Church
The breakdown in relations between Church and State which had
begun during uniÉŔcation also continued to divide Italy. This division
was exacerbated by the anti-clerical policies of the liberal governments.
Indeed, up until 1914, the Vatican had urged Catholics not to vote.
Working-class protest
The middle and upper classes dominated the political system, as the
franchise (the vote) was limited to the wealthy elites until 1930, when
all men over 30 were given the vote. The many liberal governments that
existed before the First World War had a reputation for corruption and
representing the needs of the middle and upper classes only. This led to
growing peasant and working-class unrest, which fermented into a general
strike in 1914. Working-class movements had grown in Italy from the late
19th century, and, in 1892, the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) was founded.
Most politicians at the time wanted to respond to the growing unrest with
force, and by closing down trade unions and banning parties such as the
PSI. One man who dominated Italian politics in the pre-war period, as
prime minister in 1903.05, in 1906.09 and in 1911.14, was Giovanni
Giolitti. Giolitti wanted to win the support of the masses and was willing
to work with the moderate socialists to offer electoral and welfare reform.
He also attempted to gain a rapprochement with the Church by allowing
religious education in schools.
Although GiolittiˇŻs policies were initially successful, a serious recession
undermined them and economic issues were compounded by the Italian.
Turkish war of 1911.12. Giolitti pursued this war under pressure from
Italian nationalists and was able to seize Libya from Turkey. However, the
PSI was appalled at such an imperialist war and many on the left rejected
the idea of working with the liberal parliamentary parties. The move away
from the liberals continued after the First World War, when the two
largest parties were the PSI and the Catholic Party (Partito Popolare
Italiano or PPI).
Liberal democracy
This describes a government
which is based on both the ideas
of democracy and of liberalism.
Thus, people of the country
can choose the government in
open and free elections, and the
individual rights of the people
are protected by law.
85
CHAPTER 2.1: THE IMPACT OF FASCISM ON ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY: THE ORIGINS, 1870.1933
Nationalist opposition
The Italian Nationalist Association
had been founded in 1910. A poet,
Filippo Marinetti, also established
the Futurist Movement. This
movement gloriÉŔed war and
criticized the weakness of liberal
governments for failing to
become a ˇ°Great Powerˇ±, which
Marinetti believed should
have been ItalyˇŻs destiny after
uniÉŔcation. The nationalists
also believed that uniÉŔcation
was unÉŔnished because the
regions of Trentino and Trieste
remained under Austrian rule
despite containing large numbers
of Italian speakers. These were
known as the terre irredente or
ˇ°unredeemed landsˇ±.
In addition, nationalists also wanted an empire to compete with Britain,
France and the new Germany. However, Libya apart, the Italians had
made only minor gains in Africa, with Eritea (in 1885) and part of
Somaliland (in 1889). They also failed in their attempt to conquer
Abyssinia in 1896; indeed, the Italians were humiliatingly defeated by
the Abyssinians at the infamous Battle of Adowa.
What was the impact of the First World War on
Italy, 1915.18?
ItalyˇŻs reasons for joining the Entente Alliance
In 1914, Europe was divided into two alliances, the Triple Entente and
the Triple Alliance. Italy had been a member of the Triple Alliance with
Germany and Austria.Hungary since 1882; however, ItalyˇŻs politicians
were deeply divided during the intervention crisis that developed after the
First World War broke out, and at ÉŔrst Italy remained neutral. However,
right-wing liberals hoped that, if Italy joined the Entente (the alliance
block of Britain, France and Russia established in 1907), they would gain
the Italian-speaking territories of the Austro.Hungarian Empire. The
prime minister, Antonio Salandra, favoured this action and signed the
Treaty ofÉľLondon with Britain, France and Russia in April 1915.
The Italian king, Victor Emmanuel III, was persuaded to back the Treaty
of London, and intervention was supported by both Nationalists and
Futurists. Intervention caused division on the left; the PSI was against
intervention, viewing the conÉżict as an ˇ°imperialistˇŻs warˇ±, but others
on the left supported intervention because they believed that it would
destroy Liberal Italy and could foster revolution. The fasci di azione
rivoluzionaria or ˇ°revolutionary action groupsˇ± were set up by left-wing
interventionists to support the war. Benito Mussolini was a leading
member of the PSI who changed his opinion during the intervention
crisis, initially opposing the war, but by October arguing in favour

Giolitti and many liberals, including most of the Chamber, opposed the
war, as did the Catholic Church. The liberals saw that Italy had little
to gain from entering the war, while the Church did not relish a war
against a fellow Catholic state, Austria.

ˇă Map of the Italian front during the First World War
The impact of war
The Italians fought the Austrians
and the Germans across a front in
Northern Italy. As was the case on
the Western Front in France and
Belgium, trenches developed and for
most of the three years of engagement
the war was static. However, at the
Battle of Caporetto in October 1917,
the Italians suffered huge losses
when they were pushed back by
the Austrians and Germans, who
advanced more than 100Éľkilometres.
At the end of the war, in October
1918, Italy ÉŔnally achieved a victory
at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto against
the Austrians. However, the human
cost of the war had been horrendous:
more than 600,000 men were dead
and hundreds of thousands wounded.
The war made Italy more politically divided. Many of the 5 million men
that served in its army were politicized, resenting the liberal government
for their mismanagement of the war. Many also resented the PSIˇŻs antiwar
stance. The workforce was mobilized to ÉŔght a ˇ°totalˇ± war, which
meant that the number of industrial workers grew. In turn, this led to
an increased membership of trade unions and the PSI, and both were
increasingly militant by the end of the war.

What is Fascism?
Fascism did not have a clear founding doctrine, and it manifested
itself differently in different countries. In general, Fascism promoted
nationalism, a strong leader or dictator, one-party government,
empire building and war. Nevertheless, it could be argued that it is
easier to understand what Fascism was by considering what it stood
against: it was anti-communist and against the class struggle,
against internationalism, against multi-party liberal democracy
and against paciÉŔsm.
FascismˇŻs growth in Europe was fostered by the impact of the First
World War. Mussolini set up his ÉŔrst Fascist units in March 1919,
called fascio di combattimento.

CHAPTER 2.1: THE IMPACT OF FASCISM ON ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY: THE ORIGINS, 1870.1933
Fascio means ˇ°groupˇ± and would become associated with the bound
sticks or fasces which Roman magistrates used as a symbol of ofÉŔce.
Mussolini probably intended the symbolism to suggest strong bonds or
ties between his men in the militia units.
Why did support for Fascism grow in Italy after
the First World War?
Following the war, Italy entered into
a period of political crisis. The liberal
governments of 1918.22 began to
lose control. As the franchise had
been extended, the liberals fared
badly in the elections of 1919 and
gained fewer than half the seats in the
chamber. Subsequently, none of the
political parties were able to form a
coherent coalition government. The
result was short-term governments
and this undermined the credibility of
the democratic parliamentary system.
Moreover, support for the government
declined further when it became clear
that liberal Prime Minister Vittorio
Emmanuelle Orlando had not obtained
the territory Italy had claimed from
the defeated Austro.Hungarian empire. Italy, having joined the war
primarily for territorial gain, received, as promised, the province of Tyrol,
the Istrian peninsular, the port of Trieste and the Dodecanese islands. It
also got a port in, and the protectorate over, Albania.
However, although not clearly stated in the Treaty of London, Italy had
also expected to gain the port of Fiume and Dalmatia.

Fiume, but his foreign minister disagreed. In the end their differences
were exploited by the other great powers and the Italians were not given
either territory. Orlando was forced to resign.
There was widespread disgust in Italy at the outcome of the Versailles
Settlement. As has been noted earlier, Italian casualties were more than
600,000 men killed and hundreds of thousands injured. The casualty
rate for Italian forces was actually higher than the casualty rate for
Britain: 39.1% of its forces were casualties compared to 35.8% for
Britain. The Italian nationalist and poet, Gabriele DˇŻAnnunzio, deemed
it a ˇ°mutilated victoryˇ±.
The Fascist Party beneÉŔted from the post-war situation. As fascism was
not based on a clear doctrine or theories it could appeal to a wide range
of groups across the class divide. Italians embraced its demands for
strict law and order after the violence on the streets following the First
World War, and it gave its members the opportunity to regain a sense of
national pride.
In the 1921 elections, 35 seats went to the Fascists (PNF), 108 to the
Catholic Party and 138 seats to the Socialists and the Communists
(newly founded in 1921). Italian politics was polarizing.
What was the impact of DˇŻAnnunzio and the Fiume aÉ˝air
on Fascism?
In September 1919, Gabriele DˇŻAnnunzio led 2,000 ex-soldiers to occupy
Fiume by force in protest against the Italian governmentˇŻs agreement
to hand the port over to Yugoslavia. The government proved too feeble
to remove DˇŻAnnunzio until Giolitti was returned as prime minister
in December 1920. The whole affair undermined the credibility of the
Italian democratic system.

divided than ever: ˇ°combatantsˇ± against

against defeatists. No conceivable form of
government could suit them all.
The war left other major legacies. They
included a thirst for justice (ˇ°land for the

What was the impact of economic factors on the rise
of Fascism?
The post-war economy was also an important factor in the rise of Fascism.
High inÉżation hit both the ÉŔxed-wage workers and the middle classes
with savings. Unemployment soared to 2 million by the end of 1919. This
situation was exacerbated by new US restrictions on immigration that meant
the southern poor could not emigrate to America to escape their poverty.
In addition, the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, in October 1917, had
led to widespread fear of communism across Europe. Between 1919
and 1920 there was extensive unrest in Italy that became known as the
ˇ°Two Red Yearsˇ± (Biennio Rosso). During this time the socialists attempted
to catalyse a Russian-style revolution. The Italian Communist Party
(Partito Comunista Italiano) was formed on 21 January 1921; however, the
strength of the left had already peaked and support passed to the Fascists
who opposed the Communists. Mussolini and the Fascists gained support
from the wealthy industrialists and landowners, as the Fascists offered
not only ideological opposition but were also prepared to confront
Socialists and Communists physically. Indeed, the conservatives initially
believed that they could manipulate and use the Fascists to their own
ends. There was complicity from the police and the army, who did not
restrain the Blackshirts from their excesses.
92

Fascism was also supported by the Catholic Church which was a
signiÉŔcant political force in Italy. Pope Pius XI backed Mussolini as he
saw the Fascists as a means of improving the position of the Church and
cementing church.state relations.
By 1922, therefore, there was a loss of faith in Italian state institutions
that had failed to bring about a ˇ°victorsˇ± peace settlement, seemed
unable to contain violence on the streets and had failed to establish a
stable post-war economy.

An extract from MussoliniˇŻs speech to the ÉŔrst
meeting of the Milan fascio in March, 1919.
I have the impression that the present regime
in Italy has failed. It is clear to everyone that
a crisis now exists. During the war all of us
sensed the inadequacy of the government;
today we know that our victory was due
solely to the virtues of the Italian people, not
to the intelligence and ability of its leaders.
We must not be faint hearted, now that the
future nature of the political system is to be
determined. We must act fast. If the present
regime is going to be superseded, we must be
ready to take its place. For this reason, we are
establishing the fasci as organs of creativity
and agitation that will be ready to rush into
the piazzas and cry out, ˇ°The right to the
political succession belongs to us, because we
are the ones who pushed the country into war
and led it to victory!ˇ±

It was not only over the issue of the supposed

the government. Nationalists who had always
considered the Liberals weak and incompetent
at running the war were now convinced
that the government would fail to defend
Italian interests at the peace conference. They
demanded that Italy should receive not only
those territories agreed with the Entente in
1915, (southern Tyrol, Trentino, Istria and parts
of Dalmatia), but should also be given the city
of Fiume on the border of Istria. When Britain
and the United States of America refused to
hand over Fiume, on the grounds that, despite
its large Italian population, it was vital to
the economy of the new Yugoslav state, the
Nationalists blamed Liberal weakness. When,
in addition, it became apparent that Italy would
be denied Dalmatia because so few Italians
lived there, and would not share in the division
of German colonies in Africa, nationalists were
outraged. To them, Italy had been cheated. Her

Watch MussoliniˇŻs March on
Rome.
How important was the March on Rome, October 1922?
By 1922, the liberal democratic government was weak and
vulnerable; the Fascists believed that their time had come and that
they were ready to take control in Italy. The key question was not
whether they should lead Italy but how they would take power. The
coalition government, led by the ÉŔrst Italian socialist prime minister,
Ivanoe Bonomi, collapsed in February 1922. This was followed by
a weak conservative coalition led by Luigi Facta that was unable to
control the increasing violence.
In August 1922, the Socialists and Communists called a general strike,
and the middle classes now believed that only Mussolini and his Fascists
could restore law and order. Mussolini made it clear in a speech in
September that he backed the monarchy, and he engaged in negotiations
with conservative politicians to support his appointment as prime
minister. Fascist squads had expelled Socialist councils in several towns
and there had been widespread rumours that there would be a Fascist
march on Rome. However, Mussolini wanted also to explore legal
means, even though he was under increasing pressure from his own
regional bosses, the Ras, to seize power.
In October 1922, talks continued with regard to the formation of a
new government that would include Fascists. Although there was
some willingness to offer Fascists cabinet posts, Mussolini would not

In pairs or small groups, use the information in this chapter and in the source
above to identify the key factors that led to MussoliniˇŻs appointment as prime
minister in 1922.
Which of these factors do you consider were the most important?
On 30th October, Mussolini arrived in Rome and Victor Emmanuel appointed
him Prime Minister. The fascist leader was not satisÉŔed with something so
unspectacular as a royal appointment. He needed to develop the myth of a
march on Rome by 300,000 armed fascists to enforce an ˇ®ultimatumˇŻ he had
given to the King, and eventually a legend was invented of Mussolini on
horseback leading the legions across the Rubicon. In reality there were fewer
than 30,000 fascist militiamen ready to march, many of whom had no arms
at all and would have been quite unable to stand up to the garrison troops
in Rome with their machine-guns and armoured cars: indeed, 400 policemen
proved sufÉŔcient to hold up the fascist trains long before they reached Rome.
Mussolini subsequently admitted this in private with amused satisfaction.
His fascist squads did not arrive in Rome until twenty-four hours after he
had asked to form a government and only after General Pugliese had orders
to let them through. But the photographers were waiting to picture their
arrival and the myth was launched of fascism winning power by an armed
insurrection after a civil war and the loss of 3,000 men. These 3,000 ÉŔctitious
ˇ°fascist martyrsˇ± soon took their place in the government sponsored history
books. . Denis Mack Smith, 1983.
accept anything less than a major role. On 16 October, Mussolini met
with leading Fascists in Milan and agreed that the time was right to
seize power.
On 24 October, a Fascist congress was held in Naples. In imitation of the
Italian uniÉŔcation leader, Garibaldi, 40,000 Black shirts chanted
A Roma (ˇ°to Romeˇ±) and declared their intention to march on Rome.
At three places, each 20 miles outside Rome, 10,000 of the planned
50,000 Fascists began to assemble. On the night of 27 October, Fascist
squads attempted to seize control of government buildings in north and
central Italy. This terriÉŔed local ofÉŔcials, who sent panicked reports back
to Rome. The government resigned, but Prime Minister Facta, who had
not taken ÉŔrm action against the Fascists before 1922, was asked to stay.
He asked the king to declare martial law so that the army could crush
the Fascist revolt. At ÉŔrst the king agreed, but he then changed his mind
and decided to side with Mussolini.
On 29 October, Mussolini received a telegram from the king:
Very urgent. Top priority, Mussolini, Milan. H.M. the King asks you to
proceed immediately to Rome as he wishes to confer with you . King Victor
Emmanuel III, 1922
Mussolini, the leader of a party that had regularly participated in
violence and had only 35 members of parliament, was offered the post of
prime minister.

CHAPTER 2.1: THE IMPACT OF FASCISM ON ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY: THE ORIGINS, 1870.1933
How did Mussolini consolidate his power?
At ÉŔrst, the Fascists had to share power with other political parties.
Mussolini was the prime minister of a coalition cabinet in which only
4 out of 12 ministers were Fascists. However, through a series of actions
on the part of both Mussolini and other parties, Mussolini was able to
move towards setting up a dictatorship:
ˇÜ In November 1922, the new government won a vote of conÉŔdence
and was able to vote in emergency powers to reform the
administration and tax system.
ˇÜ In February 1923, the Nationalists joined the Fascist Party.
ˇÜ In July 1923, the Acerbo Law was passed, which stated that the
party that won most votes in an election would automatically
be given two-thirds of the seats in parliament to make strong
government possible.
ˇÜ In April 1924, the Fascists, after a campaign of intimidation and
violence, were able to increase their representation in parliament
from 7% to 66%.
ˇÜ In May 1924, the liberal Giacomo Matteotti gave a speech in the
Italian chamber of deputies condemning Fascist violence. He was
murdered 11 days later by ex-squadristi Fascists.
ˇÜ On 3 January 1925, following a wave of revulsion in Italy
concerning MatteottiˇŻs death, Mussolini took responsibility for
the violence of the Fascists. Most members of parliament
withdrew in opposition. However, Mussolini now moved to
establish himself as Il Duce
ˇÜ In December 1925, the Law on Powers of Head of Government gave
Mussolini signiÉŔcant executive powers. Political parties and trade
unions were banned. The press was now strictly controlled. Elected
local ofÉŔcials were replaced by appointed government ofÉŔcials.
ˇÜ Between November 1926 and January 1927 the Fascist Party
increased repression and a new secret police was founded: the
OVRA. The powers of arrest were increased, trial without jury was
permitted and the scope of the death penalty was expanded to
include action against the authorities.
Did Mussolini create a totalitarian state?
A totalitarian state is one in which the government has total control
over all aspects of a citizenˇŻs life: political, economic, cultural and
social. Under Mussolini, Italians had to conform to Fascist expectations
and comply with the stateˇŻs laws. There could be no overt opposition
or criticism and this was enforced by the secret police and militia.
Employees of the State had to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime and
96

the young were mobilized to join the Fascist youth movement. A form of
cult developed around Mussolini. However, there were limitations to the
totalitarian nature of the Fascist regime. The Fascists had compromised
with powerful non-Fascists, such as the Vatican and the King.
Indeed, Mussolini could still be dismissed by the monarch while the
Church retained considerable inÉżuence in Italy. In addition, Fascism
never gained total control over the south where the Church and the
landowning elites maintained their power. This contrasts with the more
totalitarian nature of HitlerˇŻs Germany in the 1930s. Also, it was only
in 1938 that anti-semitic racial laws were implemented and there was
limited persecution of Jews until Italy became involved in the Second
World War . and even then only after Hitler had urged Mussolini to
impose them. Historian, Zara Steiner writes:
Mussolini was hardly a systematic thinker. He wrote no equivalent to Mein
Kampf. He never developed the singular and all-embracing ideology that allowed
Hitler to turn his fearsome doctrine of racial expansionism into political reality,
nor did his programme of ˇ°domestic regeneration and radical revisionismˇ± make
the same impact on Italians that HitlerˇŻs doctrines made on the German people.
There always remained competing claims and loyalties in Italy that Mussolini
could not ignore, abolish, or totally destroy. . Steiner, 2005
What factors inÉŔuenced MussoliniˇŻs
foreign policy?
To make Italy great, respected and feared. . Benito Mussolini
Unlike Hitler, Mussolini did not take power with a clear set of foreign
policy goals already in place. However, after 1925, Mussolini developed a
programme of action which included the following aims:
ˇÜ increase national pride
ˇÜ consolidate domestic support for the regime
ˇÜ revise the post-war settlement of 1919.20
ˇÜ dominate the Balkans
ˇÜ dominate the Mediterranean
ˇÜ build an Empire (gain spazio vitale or ˇ°living spaceˇ±); expand its
territories in Africa
ˇÜ foster the spread of Fascism in other countries.
These aims were a product of various factors. The disappointment over
the Versailles Settlement was key and helps to explain why Mussolini
wanted to increase national pride and make Italy (and himself) a much
more signiÉŔcant force in international politics.
Fascist ideology, with its expansionist aims, was also important. Linked
to this was MussoliniˇŻs belief that Fascist Italy could be the second
Roman Empire. Control of the Mediterranean Empire was key to his
vision of Italy as ˇ°the heir of Romeˇ±.
